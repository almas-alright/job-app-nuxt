              <p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
              <p>The following are the terms and conditions applicable to an Employee / subcontractor&rsquo;s assignment
                period with &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
                (the Contractor):</p>
              <p><u><strong>Period of Contract Agreement:</strong></u> Subcontractors are engaged for a minimum period
                of <strong>SIX months</strong>. They will be assigned to a Client Company (The Contractor&rsquo;s
                Customer). If a subcontractor wishes to terminate its contract within SIX months, notice must be given
                as per clause (r) of these Terms &amp; Conditions. Leaving the Contractor without prior notice is a
                breach of contract and may lead to a claim for damages being made against a subcontractor.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Payment of Subcontractor&rsquo;s Fee:</strong></u> The subcontractor is required to submit
                an invoice on Mondays of each week following the week of engagement, or alternatively enter into a RCTI
                agreement with the Contractor for the Contractor to prepare a RCTI invoice. Payment terms are five days
                from the invoice date. Advance payments will not be granted.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Probation period</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Continuation of the subcontract agreement is
                dependent on the Client Company&rsquo;s performance assessment provided to the Contractor after the
                first day of the subcontractor&rsquo;s assignment.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Obligation for allocating assignments:</strong></u> Upon the completion of the first day of
                the assignment, the Contractor is under no obligation to continue with the services of the
                sub-contractor.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Obligations owing to Client Company:</strong></u> During the period of any assignment, the
                subcontractor must follow the instructions of the Client Company. Subcontractors must only complete the
                assignments specifically allocated to them by the Contractor. A subcontractor should not discuss with
                the Client any matters relating to payments or remuneration. A breach of this condition may result in
                termination of the contract. The subcontractor shall return the Contractor&rsquo;s/Client Company&rsquo;s
                property, such as swipe cards and identification cards provided at the commencement of the assignment,
                on termination of the contract.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Changes to the assignment period:</strong></u> The Client Company reserves the right to make
                such changes provided that they give at least ONE hours&rsquo; notice to the subcontractor.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Notice for non-attendance at allocated assignment</strong></u>: A subcontractor that cannot
                attend an allocated assignment must provide the Contractor with at least EIGHT hours&rsquo; notice
                before the start time of the assignment. Failure to do so will result in immediate termination of the
                contract, subject to the discretion of the Contractor.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Medical Emergency:</strong></u> If a subcontractor cannot attend an assignment, because of a
                medical emergency and/or sudden sickness, they must provide the Contractor at least EIGHT hours&rsquo;
                notice before the start of the assignment. Failure to do so may lead to the termination of the contract,
                subject to the discretion of the Contractor.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Leave:</strong></u> If a subcontractor intends to go on leave, they must give at least TWO
                weeks&rsquo; notice, prior to going on leave. A request for leave may be refused unless it is necessary
                for the subcontractor to undertake the leave. Commencing leave without prior notice will result in
                immediate termination of the contract. No leave shall be granted during the first SIX months of the
                assignment, except for emergency and medical conditions. The Contractor may exercise its discretion to
                provide leave in other circumstances.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Timely &amp; accurate completion of timesheets:</strong></u> The subcontractor is
                responsible for filling in the Client Company&rsquo;s timesheets in an accurate and prompt manner. The
                subcontractor will be personally liable for any missed payments due to inaccuracies or incomplete
                timesheets.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Strictly prohibited conduct:</strong></u>Theft, robbery, cheating, bullying and any other
                misbehaviour within the Client Company&rsquo;s premises is strictly prohibited. Any such conduct will
                result in immediate termination of the contract. Consumption of alcohol and/or drugs is not permitted at
                any time during the subcontractor&rsquo;s assignments. Persons found to be intoxicated onsite will
                result in the immediate termination of their contract.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Reporting of issues:</strong></u> Any problems or difficulties faced by the subcontractors
                whilst on assignment should be reported to the Contractor promptly. In case of injuries, subcontractors
                must advise the Client Company&rsquo;s shift supervisor and the Contractor.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Training:</strong></u> The Subcontractor must undertake proper training and induction before
                beginning work. They must be aware of the tasks to be performed during the assignment and be familiar
                with fire exists and emergency procedures.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Visa Entitlement Checks:</strong></u> The subcontractor gives permission to Mates Workforce
                Pty Ltd to make Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) checks at any time from the date of signing
                this Application Form or the contract to be provided.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Safety:</strong></u> Subcontractors must carry out their duties in a safe manner so as not
                to injure themselves or any other party.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Direct engagement with the Client Company:</strong></u> A subcontractor must wait SIX months
                from the date of termination of the contract with the Contractor, before seeking any assignments
                directly from the Client Company.</p>
              <p><u><strong>Notice of Termination: </strong></u>Subcontractors engaged for less than SIX months must not
                terminate the contract without giving at least TWO weeks&rsquo; notice to the Contractor. Subcontractors
                engaged for at least SIX months who do not wish to renew the contract must advise the Contractor at
                least FOUR weeks prior to the expiration date of the contract.</p>
